# which raises KeyError on Python 3.13+ (PEP 667). Build patched wheels here so
# the final image / Cookbook never has to compile the broken sdists. See
# docker/build-realesrgan-wheels.sh for the full rationale.

# libgl1/libglib2.0-0t64/libxcb1 are runtime shared libs (libGL.so.1,
# libglib-2.0/libgthread, libxcb.so.1) that opencv-python (cv2) loads. The
# slim base omits them, so the Cookbook "install realesrgan" path imports cv2
# and dies with `libxcb.so.1: cannot open shared object file` despite a clean
# pip install. Using full opencv-python (not -headless) because basicsr/gfpgan/
# facexlib/realesrgan all depend on the `opencv-python` distribution by name.
#
# libmagic1 is the shared lib (libmagic.so.1) that python-magic dlopens for
# content-based MIME sniffing in src/upload_handler.py. We install both here
# (libmagic1 + the python-magic wrapper, below) rather than in requirements.txt
# because python-magic resolves libmagic at import time: where the lib is
# absent the import can block or raise, so keeping it image-only avoids
# regressing pip/venv installs on hosts without libmagic. Debian always has the
# lib here, so the import is instant and detection actually works.

# Docker CLI (client only — daemon stays on the host via the
# /var/run/docker.sock mount). The Debian `docker.io` package ships
# dockerd but not the client binary on slim, so grab the static client
# tarball from download.docker.com instead.
